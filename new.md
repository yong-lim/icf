## Introduce yourself!
We would love to get to know you. We have a special time during our Sunday services for visitors to introduce themselves and tell us why they're in Cambodia. 

## Have questions about the Christian faith?
If you have recently decided to follow Jesus or if you want to know more about God, the Bible or Christianity, we would be very happy to talk with you. 

## Home Groups
Home Group is a great way to get to know other believers on a more personal level. Here is where you can gather with people in a similar life stage as you, study the Bible together, seek prayer and gain support. Fun and food is also often involved! 

<h3><center>We look forward to meeting and getting to know you!</center></h3>
