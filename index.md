## Pastoral Position Available!
<br>
ICF is an English-speaking, expatriate, broadly evangelical, interdenominational
church with members from many nations, in a city with a moderate number of Christian
workers and a large number of English-speaking expats that are not yet church-goers.
Pre-covid our church had 150 adult members or more in three services and a lively
youth group, but we’ve suffered from a Covid exodus and now have about 50 adults
divided between North and South congregations (and their kids). **We are looking for
a pastor who will inspire, organize and engage us in the task of re-building our congregation.**

In the early years of ICF in the 1990’s, almost all members were Christian workers
and now increasingly the community includes believers working in the marketplace
in many fields. The ICF community includes schoolteachers, business people, relief
and development workers, missionaries, diplomats, and other professionals. Many have
demanding work roles, travel often, and experience all the usual concerns of Christians
everywhere. We desire a pastor that adheres to the theological statements in our
constitution (link below), and is able to be flexible and gracious in working with
those from a variety of perspectives.

The pastor will work in partnership with staff (currently a full-time administrator),
committed volunteers and Council of Elders (men & women).

Experience in community engagement or pastoral ministry is essential, as is some
evidence of gifting in international living or cross-cultural work. It is not
expected that all applicants have attended formal theological education at university
level, but all will be expected to demonstrate a love for and mature handling of
the Word of God, as well as some relevant experience.
