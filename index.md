## International Christian Fellowship of Phnom Penh
ICF is an international, inter-denominational, independent Christian church.
The people who make up our church come from multiple nationalities and many denominations. 

The ICF has a strong commitment to prayer, to unity across the body of Christ,
and plays a supportive role for the many ministries God has raised up for Cambodia.

Join us each week for worship, Bible-based teaching, prayer and fellowship.
